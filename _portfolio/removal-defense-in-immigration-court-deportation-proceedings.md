The Constitution provides for due process for all persons in the United States, regardless of citizenship or status.
If you or your loved one receive a Notice to Appear in immigration court for possible removal or deportation, those are not cases that you should attempt to do yourself without the assistance of a licensed and experienced lawyer. 
Jath and his team are currently undefeated in immigration court in multiple states. We have successfully achieved relief including termination of cases, prosecutorial discretion, asylum in immigration proceedings, adjustment of status, cancellation of removal, and other forms of relief for people who otherwise might be facing deportation. 
We have won cases at the immigration court level, before the Board of Immigration Appeals, and at the federal circuit court of appeals level, one level below the Supreme Court.
