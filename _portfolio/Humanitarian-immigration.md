A much maligned and misunderstood but essential niche of immigration, humanitarian immigration covers people seeking asylum due to well-founded fear of persecution based on a protected category such as race, religion, nationality, political opinion (actual or imputed), or membership in a particular social group.
Humanitarian paths also provide relief to victims of domestic violence from US citizen or green card holder spouses (VAWA), victims of crime (U) or trafficking (T), temporary protected status (TPS) for citizens of countries designated by Homeland Security, special immigrant juveniles or former interpreters who assisted the US military, and refugees who came here after waiting through years of vetting by the United Nations and the US government.
We have also helped immediate relatives of US active and veteran service members get parole-in-place
