Over the years, we have helped thousands of immigrants get their green cards as legal permanent residents, naturalize to American citizenship, or even claim their citizenship based on provisions of the law
American citizens have the right to sponsor their immediate relatives such as spouses, children, parents, sons, and daughters for legal permanent residency. They can also petition for their fiance/fiancees if they meet certain requirements.
Legal permanent residents can sponsor their spouses, children, and unmarried adult sons and daughters. 
Children born abroad that have at least one US citizen parent can in some cases claim American citizenship as long as they and the parent(s) meet certain residency, legitimation, and legal requirements.
