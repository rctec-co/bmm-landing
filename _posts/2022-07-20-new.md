Every new beginning comes from some other beginningâ€™s end. The Shao Law Firm is here to help immigrants from across the world achieve their American dreams, especially by reuniting with their family.

Under American immigration law, US citizens have the right to sponsor their immediate relatives - including spouses, parents, children, sons, and daughters. US citizens can also sponsor K-1 fiance/fiancees as long as both parties meet certain conditions.

We are here to help you. Having been an immigrant himself, our principal attorney Jath Shao is a tireless advocate for immigrants in immigration court, divorce court, or in petitions and applications with government agencies like USCIS or executive agencies like the State Department.
