Removal or deportation defense is when you, the respondent, have to defend yourselves in immigration court. These are high-stakes cases where Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) charges respondents with specific charges with the goal of legally deporting them from the United States.

Many immigration lawyers are scared of practicing in immigration court, but we enjoy fighting the bullies and defending real people and their right to stay with their family and loved ones here in America. The Constitution guarantees “all persons,” not just citizens or green card holders, the right to due process under the law. We are here to help you understand and defend your rights.

Please note that every case is different. Facts matter, laws and regulations or policies can change. In removal defense, we go in-depth into your personal situation and the situations of your US citizen and green card holder (LPR) loved ones to find all possible avenues of relief.
