All across America, it used to be that people need jobs. Now it seems like it’s the jobs that need people. Small businesses are scrambling for staff while large businesses pirate each other’s workers, in what is called the Great Resignation.

Immigrants don’t actually take jobs from Americans. Instead, we do the jobs that Americans either do not want to do or are not qualified to do. The system is not set up to help either American employers or immigrant workers. It’s set up to make sure that only qualified people immigrate and that businesses are financially capable of paying the prevailing wage for that particular profession in the area where they operate.

We have helped employers and employees navigate the immigration process.
